/* JavaScript code written by Martin Stacey, provided for the CTEC 1800 Assignment.
Its purpose is to enable and disable stylesheets, either when the user moves the mouse
over or clicks on an element, uses a dropdown menu, or resizes the page.

/* A copy of this file should be saved in the same folder as the web pages that it swaps stylesheets for.
It should be included in the web page with the following script element in the head of the page

/* This file provides TWO different ways to change stylesheets. METHOD ONE enables and disables
alternative stylesheets, using all the power of the HTML standards. METHOD TWO is much simpler
and cruder. It simply changes the value of the href attribute of one link element, to change the
stylesheet it points to.

Three practical differences: (1) With method one, the stylesheets are preloaded, so changing
stylesheets will happen extremely quickly. With method two, the stylesheets need to be retrieved
from the server and loaded, which may be unacceptably slow on a busy network. (2) If you use method one, 
the CSS validator will validate all the alternate stylesheets at once, instead of just the currently 
active one.(3) If you use method two, you could, if you really wanted to, do two or more entirely 
separate stylesheet-swaps, by changing the href values for different link elements, possibly to 
handle font-sizes and scale issues separately from overall appearance and layout.

/* METHOD ONE */

		/* 
		Link elements for permanent stylesheets, that are active all the time, DON'T have title attributes.
		Link elements for preferred stylesheets, which are active when you start, but which you can turn
		OFF (and back on), have rel="stylesheet", and a title attribute.
		Alternative stylesheets, which start disabled, but which you can turn on,
		have rel="alternate styleheet", and a title attribute.
		
		Here is an example of a group of link elements for loading alternative stylesheets.
		
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="permanentCSS.css" />
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="alternativeCSS1.css" title="bigsheet"/>
		<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="alternativeCSS2.css" title="mediumsheet"/>
		<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="alternativeCSS3.css" title="smallsheet"/>
		<link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="alternativeCSS4.css" title="specialsheet"/>

		You turn stylesheets on and off by setting the attribute disabled to
		"false" or "true".
		*/

		/*
		The function setActiveStyle() is called to change the stylesheet.
		Its one argument is a string that is the title of the stylesheet to be activated;
		it iterates through a list of all the link elements, and enables the link element loading a
		stylesheet (if any) with a title that matches the argument, and disables all other link elements 
		with titles that load stylesheets.
		
		This is how it gets used with event attributes such as onclick and onmouseover.
		The value of an event attribute is a string that contains a piece of JavaScript code that is executed
		when the event happens.
		
		<p onmouseover="setActiveStyle('secondstyle')">Moving the mouse over this element
		activates a link element whose title is <i>secondstyle</i></p>
		
		I like auxiliary functions to make things clearer. isOptionalStyleSheet() takes one argument,
		a link element, and returns a boolean - it is true if the link loads a stylesheet and that 
		stylesheet can be enabled or disabled. activateWhenMatching() takes a link element and a
		string as arguments, and if the value of the link's title attribute matches the string,
		enables the stylesheet, and otherwise disables it.
		[indexOf looks for positions of substrings within strings.]
