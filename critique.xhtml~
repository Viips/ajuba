<div class="title">DOS Attack</div>
<p>As you can tell the information graphics, I have chosen is on Playstation Network (PSN)  getting DDOS attack by some rebellious people. This graphic represents informations in really unique and well mannered structure. It starts with giving the reader a bit of background knowledge about the company such as when was it founded, its subsidiaries, employees and revenue. Then it compares those figures to the real-life situation, for example; it compares Sony's revenue to the GDP of Slovakia. As the graphic is about Playstation 3 (PS3) it then goes on to compare the unit solid compare to XBOX 360 and Wii. It also tells the reader about the number of people who subscribe to the PSN which is important because attackers where able to get some of the subscriber's credit card detail. Now he moves on to the interesting bit where he shows the attack timeline on the left-hand side and Sony's stock market price on the right-hand side. On the timeline side, he also includes PS3 triangle icon to represent Sony's action and PS3 cross icon to represent attackers move.</p>
<p>The graphic makes it clear that because of the attack, Sony has not only lost a lot of money but their reputation and loyalty among their customers and fan. In terms of losing money according to the analysts have predicted a massive $24 Billion. It doesn't give clear coat numbers of subscribers whose credit card details were stolen by the attackers.</p>
<p>The soul purpose of this graphic was to show the timeline of the attack preciously on the PSN, what effect did this had on the Sony's stock price, and how much did it actually cost Sony to fix their system. It achieves its purposes by using really good visual aid, for example, on the timeline having a triangle to represent Sony's action and cross to represent attackers move. It goes even further by including Sony's stock price for the important days to show the direct effect on a big company such as Sony.</p>
